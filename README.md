# Bit-Torrent-Client
A lightweight BitTorrent Client built in Python that demonstrates how peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing works under the hood. The client can parse .torrent files, communicate with trackers, discover peers, and download file pieces in parallel while ensuring data integrity using SHA-1 verification.
